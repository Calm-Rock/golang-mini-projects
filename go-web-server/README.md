This is a very simple Go lang server

# Steps to run this folder

Prerequisite: Have Golang [installed](https://go.dev/doc/install) on your system
### Step 1:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Calm-Rock/golang-mini-projects.git
cd go-web-server
```

### Step 2:

```golang
go run main.go
```

This will start the server at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

We have 3 routes which we can checkout
- [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
- [http://localhost:8080/hello](http://localhost:8080/hello)
- [http://localhost:8080/form.html](http://localhost:8080/form.html)
